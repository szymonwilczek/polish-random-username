# Contribute

## Introduction

First, thank you for considering contributing to my plugin! It's people like you that make the open source community such a great community! ðŸ˜Š

We welcome any type of contribution, not only code. You can help with

- **QA**: file bug reports, the more details you can give the better
- **Marketing**: writing blog posts, howto's, printing stickers, ...
- **Community**: presenting the project at meetups, organizing a dedicated meetup for the local community, ...
- **Code**: take a look at the [open issues](https://github.com/szymonwilczek/random-username/issues). Even if you can't write code, commenting on them, showing that you care about a given issue matters. It helps us triage them.
- **Money**: we welcome financial contributions in full transparency.

## Submitting code

Any code change should be submitted as a pull request. Our guidelines for Pull Requests:

- Please fill in our template in its entirety. Please don't reformat it or modify it
- The description should explain what the code does and give steps to execute it
- The pull request should also contain tests
- Before submitting your Pull Request, please lint your changes by running `pnpm lint` in the root directory
- If any checks fail for your Pull Request, please resolve them. Always feel free to ask for help if unable to resolve issues with checks

## Code review process

The bigger the pull request, the longer it will take to review and merge. Try to break down large pull requests in smaller chunks that are easier to review and merge.

It is also always helpful to have some context for your pull request. What was the purpose? Why does it matter to you? Does it resolve any known Github issues? Adding a line "resolves #<issue number>" (e.g. "resolves #23") to the description of your pull request or of a specific commit will automatically close this issue once the pull request is merged.

## Financial contributions

We also welcome financial contributions in full transparency..
Anyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be "merged" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.

## Questions

If you require technical assistance, [mail](mailto:szymonwilczek@outlook.com) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/4TWmMfMU6N) are usually the best places to start.
You can also create an issue (protip: do a quick search first to see if someone else didn't ask the same question before!).
